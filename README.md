# LLVM with Program Repository Support

This git repository contains a copy of LLVM (forked from commit 7b5565418f4d6e113ba805dad40d471d23bca6f6) with work-in-progress modifications to output to a Program Repository.

The changes are to add support for the program repository that was first shown at the [2016 US LLVM Developers’ meeting](https://llvm.org/devmtg/2016-11/) in the talk catchily titled “Demo of a repository for statically compiled programs”. You can relive the highs and lows by [watching it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/-pL94rqyQ6c). The early implementation demonstrated there has its [own Github repository](https://github.com/SNSystems/Toy-tools): in essence, this work re-implements the same thing in LLVM to give you the anticipated build-time improvements in a C++ compiler targeting Linux. Further documentation can be found on the [project wiki](https://github.com/SNSystems/llvm-project-prepo/wiki).

## Building the Compiler

The process to follow is similar to that for a conventional build of Clang+LLVM, but with an extra step to get the [pstore](https://github.com/SNSystems/pstore) back-end.

1. Clone llvm-project-prepo (this repository):

        $ git clone https://github.com/SNSystems/llvm-project-prepo.git

1. Clone [pstore](https://github.com/SNSystems/pstore):

        $ cd llvm-project-prepo
        $ git clone https://github.com/SNSystems/pstore.git
        $ cd -

   Ultimately, we envisage supporting multiple database back-ends to fit different needs, but there’s currently a hard dependency on the pstore (“Program Store”) key/value store as a back-end.


1. Build LLVM as [normal](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html) enabling the clang and pstore subprojects (e.g.):

        $ mkdir build && cd build
        $ cmake -G "Ninja" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;pstore" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 -DLLVM_TOOL_CLANG_TOOLS_EXTRA_BUILD=OFF ../llvm
        $ ninja

## Using the Program Repository

### Compiling
The program-repository is implemented as a new object-file format (“repo”) in LLVM. To use it, you need to request it explicitly in the target triple:

    $ clang -target x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-repo -c -o test.o test.c

Note that this is the only triple that we’re currently supporting (i.e. targeting X86-64 Linux).

Furthermore, the path to the program-repository database itself is set using an environment variable `REPOFILE`; it that variable is not set, it defaults to `./clang.db` (eventually, you’d expect to be able to specify this path with a command-line switch).

The command-line above will write the object code for `test.c` to the program-repository and emit a “ticket file” `test.o`. This tiny file contains a key to the real data in the database.

### Linking
A program-repository aware linker is very much on the project’s [“TODO” list](wiki/Limitations#missing-features). Until that happens, there's a `repo2obj` tool in the project tree. This generates a traditional ELF file from a repository ticket file. Using it is simple:

    $ clang -target x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-repo -c -o test.o test.c
    $ repo2obj test.o -o test.o.elf

The first step compiles the source file `test.c` to the repository, the second will produce a file `test.o.elf` which can be fed to a traditional ELF linker.

    $ clang -o test test.o.elf
    $ ./test
